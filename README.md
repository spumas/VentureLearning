# Venture Learning.

A web app for a collection of resources regarding self learning and personality development wrapped in a nice design that doesn't scare you off like Wikipedia

## Description

 I had an idea for a website/app but i feel like it exists somewhere already, i am 100% sure though that wrapping it in a design and making it very accessible on all platforms is gonna make it better than most forms of platforms that offer such content.

## Current stage of this project

As of right now the plan is as follows:

- Turn the Concept (referencing to the Figma project file) into a static template that includes the hamburger menu, each of the neccessary pages such as settings, profile and more. Obviously HTML/CSS and JS

- early steps into making a REST API for everything back-end as all functions are gona be server-side. I was thinking Ruby / JS / Python

- the latter will follow up into transferring everything into ReactJS to turn it into a deployable mobile app (only iOS as Android will require a million different changes for each of the devices and I am a one man team which makes that impossible)
